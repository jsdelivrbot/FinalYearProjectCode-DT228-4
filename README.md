The configration file can be created using the QuickConfig script else use the following template to stored the information
```javascript
{
  "databases": [
    {
      "database": "database-name-goes-here",
      "password": "password-goes-here",
      "port": "port-goes-here",
      "uri": "uri-goes-here",
      "username": "username-goes-here"
    }
  ],
  "gmaps": "google-maps-key-goes-here",
  "token": {
    "secret": "jwt-secret-goes-here"
  }
}
```
